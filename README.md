# FMCG_Sales_Finance_Analytics_Project


I'm excited to showcase my work on a project in the FMCG domain, focusing on Sales & Finance Analytics! In this project, I created various insightful reports to empower businesses with comprehensive customer and financial insights.

## For Sales:

- Market performance vs. target reports: Uncovered which markets were ahead of the game and where we had room to grow, leading the way to achieving business goals!

- And more! These reports provided valuable insights to understand customer behavior, sales patterns, and market performance.

## For Finance:

- Profit & Loss analysis: Calculated key metrics like net sales, COGS, gross margin, and margin %, tracking them across time periods and markets.
